# Rust WASM algorithms

This project is configured to compile to WebAssembly (WASM) and includes several algorithms implemented in Rust. The algorithms present in this repository are:

- **Quicksort**: An efficient sorting algorithm.
- **Binary Search**: An algorithm for binary search in a sorted array.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Functions for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Algorithms

### 1. **Quicksort**
The Quicksort algorithm is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer technique. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements smaller and larger than the pivot, recursively sorting the sublists.

### 2. **Binary Search**
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a value in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the array in half and compares the target value with the value in the middle of the array, reducing the search range until the target is found or determined to be absent.

### 3. **Temperature Conversion**
The temperature conversion functions allow conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. These functions use simple formulas to convert values from one unit to another.
